    <p>
      If you've just gotten your first period: you’re not alone, and you’re totally normal.
      Getting your first period is a big moment in your life — it means your body is growing and changing. But what exactly is a period, and why does it happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      A period, also called menstruation, is when blood and some tissue come out of your vagina for a few days every month. This happens because your body is preparing itself for the possibility of pregnancy, even if you’re not planning on having a baby anytime soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside your body, you have an organ called the uterus (or womb), which is where a baby would grow if you got pregnant. Every month, your uterus builds up a soft lining made of blood and tissue to get ready for a fertilized egg. If no pregnancy happens, your body doesn’t need this lining, so it sheds it — and that’s what comes out as your period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Periods usually last about 3 to 7 days, and the blood might be bright red or darker. Along with your period, you might notice some cramps or discomfort in your lower belly, feeling bloated, sore breasts, or mood changes — all of these are normal and caused by hormones working in your body.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you get your period, you’ll need to use products like pads or tampons to absorb the blood and stay clean and comfortable. Pads are often easiest to start with because they just stick to your underwear.
      It’s a good idea to carry a pad with you just in case your period starts when you’re out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, your periods might not come exactly every month — sometimes they’re irregular and unpredictable, but over time, they usually become more regular. It’s helpful to track your periods in a notebook or an app to know when to expect the next one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, getting your period is a natural and healthy part of growing up. It means your body is doing what it’s supposed to do. If you ever feel confused, scared, or have questions, don’t hesitate to talk to a parent, older sibling, teacher, or doctor — they’re there to help you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your first period might feel a little strange or uncomfortable at first, but with time, you’ll get used to it and learn how to take care of yourself during this special time each month.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2.Why Does It Happen?</h2>
    <p>
      You have just gotten your first period, you might be wondering: Why does this happen every month? Don’t worry — it’s completely normal, and it’s all part of how your body grows and changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside your body, there’s a special place called the uterus (or womb). This is where a baby can grow if you ever decide to have children in the future. Each month, your body prepares the uterus for this by building up a soft lining made of blood and nutrients. Think of it like laying out a cozy, soft bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lining is ready to support a fertilized egg — that means an egg that has joined with a sperm and started growing. But if this doesn’t happen (and it won’t unless you have sex), your body doesn’t need the lining. So, your uterus gently breaks down this lining and pushes it out through your vagina as period blood. This process is called menstruation, or simply your period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole cycle is controlled by hormones, which are chemical messengers in your body. These hormones tell your uterus when to build up the lining and when to shed it. Because your body is still getting used to these new hormones, your periods might be irregular at first — sometimes coming early or late — and that’s totally normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Periods usually last about 3 to 7 days, and while you’re on your period, you might notice cramps, bloating, or mood swings. These feelings happen because your body is adjusting and responding to all the changes inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, getting your period is a sign that your body is healthy and growing up. It’s a natural part of life, and with time, you’ll learn how to take care of yourself during your cycle. If you ever have questions or feel unsure, talking to a parent, teacher, or doctor can really help.

    <h2>3.What Does a Period Feel Like?</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="{% static 'images/feel.jpg' %}" alt="Illustration of common symptoms during menstruation" class="img-center">
    </div>
    <p>
      When you get your period, you might notice a few different things happening in your body and mood — and that’s totally normal!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Blood:</strong> You’ll see blood coming from your vagina. It can be bright red or sometimes darker brown. Some days it might be light, and other days heavier. This usually lasts around 3 to 7 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cramps:</strong> Many girls feel cramps or aching in their lower belly or back. It might feel like a dull, tight pain. This happens because your uterus is gently squeezing to help shed the lining. Cramps can be mild or stronger, but they usually get better with rest, heat (like a warm water bottle), or medicine if you need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bloating and Soreness:</strong> You might feel bloated or puffier around your stomach, and your breasts might feel tender or sore. This happens because of hormonal changes in your body.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mood Changes:</strong> It’s normal to feel more emotional, moody, or tired around your period. Your hormones affect how you feel, so sometimes you might feel happy one moment and upset the next. That’s okay!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Other Signs:</strong> Some girls get headaches, feel more tired, or notice changes in their appetite.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Remember, everyone’s experience is a little different. Your body is unique, and over time, you’ll learn what your period feels like and how to manage it best.</strong></p>

  <h2> 4.How Often Will My Period Come?</h2>
  <div class="image-container">
      <img src="{% static 'images/women.jpg' %}" alt="Group of women smiling and supporting each other"class="img-center">
    </div>
    <p>When you first start getting your period, it might feel a little confusing because it doesn’t always come every month like a clock. This happens because your body is still learning how to manage hormones — the chemicals that tell your uterus when to build up and shed the lining. At first, your periods might come close together or be several weeks apart, and sometimes you might skip a month entirely. This irregular cycle is very normal during the first few years after your period starts.
   Usually, after a while, your body figures out a rhythm, and your periods begin to come about once every 28 to 30 days. But even then, it’s normal for your cycle to be a little shorter or longer — anywhere between 21 and 35 days is considered healthy. So, if your period comes a little early or late sometimes, don’t worry. Your body is unique, and cycles can change with stress, illness, or changes in your routine.
   If your period has never come more than a few months, or if it suddenly stops for a long time and you’re not pregnant, it’s a good idea to talk to a doctor. But most teens have irregular periods at first, and that’s perfectly okay. Just keep track of your cycle by writing down the dates when your period starts and ends — this will help you understand your own body better over time.</p>
</div>
   <div class="section">
   <h2>5.How Long Will My Period Last?</h2>
    <p>When you first get your period, it might last for just a few days or sometimes a bit longer. Usually, periods last between 3 to 7 days. Some girls have shorter periods, like 2 or 3 days, and others might have longer ones — and both are completely normal.

It’s also normal for the amount of bleeding to change during your period. Some days you might have a heavier flow, and other days it might be very light. Your body is just getting used to the whole process, so don’t worry if it’s different every time at first.

As you get older, your periods might become more regular in length and flow. But remember, every girl’s body is different, so your experience might not be the same as your friends’.

If your period lasts longer than a week or you have very heavy bleeding (like soaking through a pad every hour), it’s a good idea to talk to a doctor. Otherwise, what you’re experiencing is just part of your body’s natural way of growing and changing.</p>
    </div>  
<div class="section">
<h2> 6.Is it okay to exercise during my period? Can I still play sports or work out?</h2>
      <p>Yes, it’s totally fine to exercise during your period! In fact, moving your body can help reduce cramps and make you feel better. You can play sports, dance, or do any activity you like. Just listen to your body — if you feel tired, take it easy.</p>
       </div>  
      <div class="section">
      <h2>7.What products should I use — pads, tampons, or something else? How do I know which one is right for me?</h2>
      <div class="image-container">
      <img src="{% static 'images/pad.jpg' %}" alt="Image of sanitary pads for menstrual care"class="img-center">
    </div>
      <p>There are many period products like pads, tampons, menstrual cups, and period underwear. Pads are great if you’re just starting because they’re easy to use and don’t go inside your body. Tampons and menstrual cups go inside the vagina and can be more convenient for swimming or sports. Try different ones to see what feels best and most comfortable for you.</p>
       </div>  
      <div class="section">
      <h2>8.Can I swim when I have my period? Is it safe or hygienic?</h2>
      <p>Yes, you can swim during your period! Many girls use tampons or menstrual cups while swimming to stay clean and comfortable. Just make sure to change your tampon or empty your cup before and after swimming to stay fresh.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
      <h2>9.What if my period is really painful? When should I see a doctor?</h2>
      <div class="image-container">
      <img src="{% static 'images/pain.jpg' %}" alt="Girl holding her lower abdomen in pain due to cramps"class="center">
    </div>
      <p>Some cramps are normal, but if the pain is very strong and stops you from doing daily activities, you should talk to a doctor. They can check if everything is okay and suggest treatments to help with the pain.</p>
  </div>
      <div class="section">
      <h2>10.Is it normal to have mood swings or feel emotional? What causes these feelings?</h2>
      <div class="image-container">
      <img src="{% static 'images/emotion.jpg' %}" alt="Woman showing different emotions during period"class="img-center">
    </div>
      <p>Yes, mood swings and feeling emotional are normal during your period. Hormones in your body go up and down, and this can affect your feelings. Sometimes you might feel happy one minute and sad the next. It’s okay — it’s just your body’s way of adjusting.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
      <h2>11.Can I get pregnant during my period? How does fertility work?</h2>
      <p>It’s less likely but still possible to get pregnant during your period because sperm can live inside your body for several days. Ovulation (when an egg is released) happens around the middle of your cycle, but cycles can be different for everyone. If you want to avoid pregnancy, it’s important to use protection every time you have sex.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
      <h2>12.What if my period doesn’t come? When should I be worried about missing a period?</h2>
       <div class="image-container">
      <img src="{% static 'images/miss.jpg' %}" alt="Calendar with missed period dates marked" class="img-center">
    </div> 
      <p>Missing a period sometimes is normal, especially when you’re just starting or if you’re stressed or sick. But if you miss more than three periods in a row or if you think you might be pregnant, see a doctor to find out what’s going on.</p>
  </div>
      <div class="section">
      <h2>13.Why do I sometimes get acne or breakouts during my period? Is this normal?</h2>
<div class="image-container">
      <img src="{% static 'images/acne.jpg' %}" alt="Close-up of skin with acne during menstruation" class="img-center">
    </div> 
      <p>Yes, acne during your period is very common! Hormones can cause your skin to make more oil, which can lead to pimples. It usually gets better after your period ends.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
      <h2>14.Can I use tampons if I’m a virgin? Will it hurt?</h2>
      <p>Yes, you can use tampons if you’re a virgin. It might feel strange at first, but it shouldn’t hurt if you relax and insert it gently. If it’s uncomfortable, you can try smaller tampons or use pads instead until you feel ready.</p>
</div>
      <div class="section">
      <h2>16.Why do I get cramps? Can I stop them?</h2>
     <div class="image-container">
      <img src="{% static 'images/cramp.jpg' %}" alt="Illustration of uterus contracting causing cramps" class="img-center">
    </div>
      <p>Cramps happen because your uterus is squeezing to help shed its lining during your period. They can feel like a dull ache or sharp pain in your lower belly or back. You can reduce cramps by using a warm heat pack, resting, exercising gently, or taking pain relief medicine if needed.</p>
