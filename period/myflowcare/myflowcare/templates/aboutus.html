  <h1>About FlowCare</h1>

  <p>
    Periods are a natural part of life — but for many, they still come with uncertainty, discomfort, and unanswered questions. At FlowCare, we believe that every person deserves to understand their body, track their health with ease, and feel supported through every cycle.
  </p>

  <p>
    FlowCare started with a simple idea: what if menstrual health could be managed in one safe, reliable, and friendly space? We wanted to create more than just a tracker — we wanted to build a companion. A platform that helps you not only know when your period is coming, but also prepares you with tips, remedies, and emotional support along the way.
